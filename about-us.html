			<h1>What is Read More Spanish?</h1>

			<h2>About The Site</h2>
			<p class="lit">Read More Spanish is a resource for intermediate to advanced Spanish-language students who 
			want to practice thier reading comprehension skills. Most intermediate students are able to 
			understand Spanish when it's spoken aloud, but struggle with understanding Spanish in printed 
			form. Comprehension is an essential skill for language students and will help them both in the 
			classroom and in the real world. Comprehension is especially important if you hope one day to 
			teach Spanish, move to a Spanish-speaking country, or be able to effectively express yourself 
			with naitive speakers.</p> 

			<h2>The Future</h2>
			<p class="lit">Right now, Read More Spanish allows visitors to generate and read a random passage of text 
			from a classic work of fiction. After reading the passage, visitors are encouraged to Tweet 
			and share what they've read.  It's our goal to grow the site to include comprehension exercises 
			that ask questions about the text and allow you to type responses, a spell check feature that 
			corrects the spelling and grammar in your responses, and implement a scorecard that tracks how 
			many passages you've Tweeted and awards badges the more you read and share.</p>

			<h2>How You Can Help</h2>
			<p class="lit">We are always looking to expand our resource library. If you wish to contribute to the 
			site by sending us original Spanish-language works or a Spanish translation of an existing 
			work of fiction, visit the <a href="contact/form.html">Contact Us</a> section and drop us a line!</p>
